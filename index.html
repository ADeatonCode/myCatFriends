  <h2>
    Tabitha and Black
  </h2>
  <p1>
    The best furry friends in my life are cats. When I was released from Whiteville in February, I found refuge at Room in the inn.  When I was walking around the facility, I found two partially ferrel cats I named Tabbitha and Black for obvious reasons.  They hang out arround our Kitchen and when they get the chance for a morsal or two of food they are ore then happy to devour it.

    At first only Tabbitha would come up to me.  She is a female.  When Black saw she was ok with me he would come up for his daily dose of petting and scrathing.  They are both peas in a pod and are found together nearly all the time. It is theropy for me to pet and play with them both.

    One day I found them chasing a butterfly outside the kitchen door.  The beautiful monarch was one step ahead of them and before long and climbed ten stories to get away.  After that we sat down on the steps and I pulled out my lanyard and let them play with it.

  <h2> Mr. Pickles</h2>
  <p5>
    I work double shifts on Friday, Saturday and Sundays at Jimmy Johns making sandwiches.  One night I was taking the trash to the dumpster and on my return, I heard a kitten crying in the bushes in the retintion pond.  I went to investigate, but as I approached, the kitten stopped crying and became quiet.  Later I told my coworker about it but the kitten never made a noise.

    <p6>
     The next night when we closed the store, there he was again!  The distinct sound of his meowing could be heard.  When my coworker came out I motioned for her to listen, and sure enough here came the cries out of the water collection area between our store and Chick Fila. She had cat food in her car and quickly ran and got some out.  Then she went into the retention pond looking for the kitten.  This spooked the kitten, and standing at the top I watch the greyish ball of fur run for the hillside away from her.  She sat some food down by the bushes and we went home.
    </P6>

    <P7>
    We continued to leave food off and on for another week, when one night while my coworker was at the store, the  kitten decide to come up to the store looking for where the tasty morsals came from that he was finding. An employee noticed him in the bushes outside the store and my coworker quickly went out to find him in a bush.  She picked him up and brought him into the store and put him in a box with some fresh baked chicken.  As he peered out from under the lid of the box, he was scared, but somehow realized that these humans were here to help.  
    </P7>
    <br/></br/>
    <p8>
    She took the kitten home with her and after a few hours the kitten was relaxing and purring.  After some time, he would cuddle up with my coworker an sleep in her lap.  He also liked all the toys he now had to play with without the danger of being on the street.  As my coworker would say, he went from the streets to the sheets.  The kitten earned the name Mr. "Memphis" Pickles, and is the unofficial mascott of Jimmy John's Melrose.

    Now Mr. Pickle's personallity has come out, and he has filled out into a normal cat.  He likes chasing his favorite ball toy and also sleeping with and playing with his lamb chop.  He is cute and amazing.  I was glad to play a small part in his rescue.

    <h2>My new companion Piper</h2>
    <br/>
    <p10>
           My new friend Piper was rescued by cat Rescue of Nashville.  She had been in the shelter for a little while before I found her.  She was so friendly and likable that I had to adopt her.  When I got everything I needed and as the assistant at PetSmart loaded her into her carrier bag, I took her out with her gear.  She was frightened at first, but once I got her home, I immediately let her out of her carrier bag and she became much more relaxed.
